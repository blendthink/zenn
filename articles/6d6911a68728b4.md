## 必要な情報

### どこから Dart SDK の情報を取得できるか

公式ドキュメントがどこの情報を元に取得しているか確認

https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive

Chrome の DevTools で確認すると

以下の API を呼び出していることが判明

- `https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/dart-archive/o?delimiter=%2F&prefix=channels%2Fstable%2Frelease%2F&alt=json`
- `https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/dart-archive/o?delimiter=%2F&prefix=channels%2Fbeta%2Frelease%2F&alt=json`
- `https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/dart-archive/o?delimiter=%2F&prefix=channels%2Fdev%2Frelease%2F&alt=json`

これってなんなんだ？ 🤔

調べてみたら、Google Cloud Storage の JSON API を使っていました。

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/list

つまり、Cloud Storage にアップしてるのですね。

Dart の公式ドキュメントのソースコードを確認してみると、[googleapis] を利用していて、ぱっと見では分かりませんが確かに使っていました。

### Rust で API Client はあるの？

残念ながら、現時点（2022/09/17）では公式では無いようです。

ただ、Crate.io にはいくつか非公式のものでありました。

自分で作った方が早い

    "channels/stable/release/45396/",
    "channels/stable/release/45692/",
    "channels/stable/release/latest/"
  ]
}
```

構造的にはこんな感じ
いったん、`nextPageToken` は無視でも良さそう

```json
{
  "kind": "storage#objects",
  "nextPageToken": "string",
  "prefixes": [
    "string"
  ]
}
```
